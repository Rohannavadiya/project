                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li class="uli"><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine chickpea flour, semolina, turmeric powder, asafoetida, carom seeds, and salt.</li>
                        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of hot oil to the mixture and mix well.</li>
                        <li>Gradually add water and knead the mixture into a firm, smooth dough. The dough should not be too soft or too stiff. Add water as needed to achieve the right consistency.</li>
                        <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Divide and Roll:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>After resting, divide the dough into small lemon-sized balls.</li>
                        <li>Take a portion of the dough and roll it into a long cylindrical shape, about 5-6 inches long and 1/4 inch thick. Repeat this process with the remaining dough balls.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Shape the Fafda:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Heat sufficient oil in a deep frying pan or kadhai over medium heat.</li>
                        <li>Once the oil is hot, take a rolled dough cylinder and gently press it between your palms to flatten it slightly.</li>
                        <li>Using your fingers, create small longitudinal impressions on the surface of the dough to give it the traditional fafda texture. Optionally, sprinkle some sesame seeds and press them gently onto the fafda.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Fry the Fafda:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Carefully slide the shaped fafda into the hot oil, one or two at a time, depending on the size of your pan. Do not overcrowd the pan.</li>
                        <li>Fry the fafda on medium heat, flipping occasionally, until they turn golden brown and crispy on both sides.</li>
                        <li>Once fried, remove the fafda using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil by placing them on paper towels or a wire rack.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Repeat the frying process with the remaining dough portions until all the fafdas are cooked.</li>
                        <li>Allow the fafdas to cool slightly before serving.</li>
                        <li>Serve fafda with green chutney, fried green chilies, or jalebi for a traditional Gujarati snack experience.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
