    <h1>Patra Recipe</h1>
        <p>Patra, also known as Alu Vadi or Pateria, is a popular Gujarati delicacy made from colocasia leaves (also known as taro leaves) and gram flour (besan). This dish is characterized by its savory, tangy, and slightly sweet flavor profile, combined with the earthiness of the colocasia leaves. Patra is enjoyed as a snack, appetizer, or side dish, and it pairs perfectly with tangy chutneys or a cup of hot tea.</p>
