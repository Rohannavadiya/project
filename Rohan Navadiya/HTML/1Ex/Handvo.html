    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Batter:</strong> Wash and soak rice, toor dal, chana dal, urad dal, and moong dal together in water for about 4-6 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li><strong>Grind:</strong> Drain the soaked rice and lentils and grind them into a smooth batter using a blender or food processor. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Vegetables and Spices:</strong> Transfer the batter to a large mixing bowl. Add grated bottle gourd, carrot, zucchini, ginger, green chilies, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin seeds, mustard seeds, asafoetida, yogurt, oil, and salt. Mix everything well.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Handvo:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a round baking dish with oil and pour the batter into it. Sprinkle baking soda on top of the batter and gently mix it in.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 35-40 minutes or until the Handvo is golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the Handvo to cool slightly before slicing it into wedges. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve warm with chutney or yogurt.</li>
