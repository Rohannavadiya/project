    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dal:</strong> Wash the toor dal thoroughly and soak it in water for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the Dough:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine wheat flour, a pinch of salt, and enough water to make a stiff dough. Knead the dough well and set it aside for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Dal:</strong> In a pressure cooker, add the soaked toor dal along with chopped tomatoes, green chilies, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and salt. Add water as needed and pressure cook for about 3-4 whistles or until the dal is soft and cooked.</li>
        <li><strong>Roll and Cut the Dhoklis:</strong> Divide the dough into small balls and roll them out into thin discs. Cut the discs into small diamond-shaped pieces (dhoklis).</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Dhoklis:</strong> Once the dal is cooked, add the prepared dhoklis to the dal and cook uncovered for about 15-20 minutes or until the dhoklis are cooked through and tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Temper the Dal Dhokli:</strong> In a small pan, heat oil or ghee. Add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and asafoetida. Let them splutter. Pour this tempering over the cooked dal dhokli.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Garnish the dal dhokli with fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot with a squeeze of lemon juice on top, if desired.</li>
