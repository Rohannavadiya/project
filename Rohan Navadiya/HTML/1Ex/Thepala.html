        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine whole wheat flour, gram flour, chopped fenugreek leaves, ginger paste, green chilies, turmeric powder, red chili powder, cumin seeds, carom seeds, salt, and 1 tablespoon of oil.</li>
                    <li>Mix the ingredients well using your hands until they resemble coarse crumbs.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add yogurt and knead the mixture into a smooth dough. If the dough is too dry, add a little water at a time until you get a soft, pliable dough.</li>
                    <li>Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Divide and Roll:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>After resting, divide the dough into small lemon-sized balls.</li>
                    <li>Take one dough ball and roll it out into a thin, round disc using a rolling pin. Dust the rolling surface and the dough with flour as needed to prevent sticking.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Cook Thepala:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Heat a tawa or skillet over medium heat. Once hot, place the rolled out Thepala onto the tawa.</li>
                    <li>Cook for about 1-2 minutes on one side until you see bubbles forming on the surface.</li>
                    <li>Flip the Thepala and drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges and on the surface.</li>
                    <li>Press gently with a spatula and cook until both sides are golden brown and cooked through.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the same process with the remaining dough balls until all Thepalas are cooked.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Serve Thepalas hot with yogurt, pickle, or any chutney of your choice.</li>
                    <li>They can also be packed for lunch or enjoyed as a snack.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Thepalas can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. You can also freeze them for longer storage.</li>
                </ol>
